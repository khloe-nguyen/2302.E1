        <h3>Lemon Tree</h3>
        [Verse 1]
        I'm sittin' here in the boring room
        It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
        I'm wastin' my time; I got nothin' to do
        I'm hangin' around; I'm waitin' for you
        But nothing ever happens, and I wonder
        
        [Verse 2]
        I'm drivin' around in my car
        I'm drivin' too fast; I'm drivin' too far
        I'd like to change my point of view
        I feel so lonely; I'm waitin' for you
        But nothing ever happens, and I wonder
        
        
        [Chorus]
        I wonder how; I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
        (Aaa) I'm turnin' my head up and down
        I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
        And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
        
        [Post-Chorus]
        Sing!
        Dap, dadada-dadpm, didap-da
        Dadada-dadpm, didap-da
        Dap, didili-da
        
        [Verse 3]
        I'm sittin' here; I missed the power
        I'd like to go out. Takin' a shower
        But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
        I feel so tired; put myself into bed
        Well, nothing ever happens, and I wonder
        
        [Bridge]
        Isolation is not good for me
        Isolation; I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
        
        [Verse 4]
        I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
        Baby, anyhow, I'll get another toy
        And everything will happen, and you wonder

        [Chorus]
        I wonder how; I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
        And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
        (Aaa) I'm turnin' my head up and down
        I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
        And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
        And I wonder, wonder
        (Aaa) I wonder how; I wonder why
        Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue, blue sky
        
        [Outro]
        And all that I can see (Ah, dip-dip-dip-dip)
        And all that I can see (Ah, dip-dip-dip-dip)
        And all that I can see (Aaa)
        Is just a yellow lemon tree
